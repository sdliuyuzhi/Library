# Contributing to js-amino
Thank you for considering a contribution to **js-amino**! This guide explains how to:
* Get started
* Development workflow
* Get help if you encounter trouble


## Get in touch
Before starting to work on a feature or a fix, please [open an issue](https://github.com/cybercongress/js-amino/issues/new/choose) to discuss the use case or bug with us. This can
save both you and us a lot of time. For any non-trivial change, we'll ask you to create a short design document explaining:

* Why is this change done? What's the use case?
* What test cases should it have? What could go wrong?
* How will it roughly be implemented? (We'll happily provide code pointers to save you time)


## Development Workflow

### Fork repo
Fork repo to your account to continue work there.

### Creating Commits And Writing Commit Messages
The commit messages that accompany your code changes are an important piece of documentation, please follow these guidelines when writing commit messages:

* Keep commits discrete: avoid including multiple unrelated changes in a single commit
* Keep commits self-contained: avoid spreading a single change across multiple commits. A single commit should make sense in isolation
* Include GitHub issue in the commit message on a first line at the beginning. Example:

```
#123 Refactor CONTRIBUTING.md

--Add Creating Commits And Writing Commit Messages Section
```

### Submitting Your Change
After you submit your pull request, a core developer will review it. It is normal that this takes several
iterations, so don't get discouraged by change requests. They ensure the high quality that we all enjoy.


## Getting Help
If you run into any trouble, please reach out to us on the issue you are working on.


## Our Thanks
We deeply appreciate your effort toward improving js-amino. For any contribution, large or small, you will be immortalized
 in the release notes for the version you've contributed to.
